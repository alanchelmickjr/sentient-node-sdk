# Migration from Sentient Agent Framework (Python) to Sentient Node SDK (Node.js)

## Overview

This document outlines the process of migrating the functionalities from the Sentient Agent Framework (Python) to the Sentient Node SDK (Node.js). The migration involved identifying key functionalities, translating them into Node.js code, and testing each translated functionality.

## Steps

1. **Identify Functionalities**
   - Used the `codebase_search` tool to identify key functionalities in the Sentient Agent Framework.
   - Identified the following functionalities:
     - `SentientAgentClient`: A client for interacting with the Sentient Agent Framework.
     - `SentientAgentClientCLI`: A command-line interface for testing agents built with the Sentient Agent Framework.
     - `ResponseEventAdapter`: A utility for validating and converting JSON objects to response events.
     - Event factories: Factories for creating different types of events.
     - Interfaces: Various interfaces for defining agents, handling responses, and emitting events.

2. **Translate Functionalities into Node.js Code**
   - Switched to the `code` mode to write the new file `src/client/sentient_agent_client.ts`.
   - Implemented the `SentientAgentClient` class in TypeScript, providing methods for querying agents and processing server-sent events.
   - Added public getter methods to access private properties for testing purposes.

3. **Test Translated Functionalities**
   - Created a test file `tests/sentient_agent_client.test.ts` to test the `SentientAgentClient` class.
   - Wrote a test case to verify that the `queryAgent` method correctly queries the agent and emits the `querySuccess` event.
   - Ran the test using `pnpm test` and confirmed that the test passed.

## Issues Encountered

- **Module Not Found Errors**
  - Initially encountered errors related to missing `events` and `axios` modules.
  - Resolved by installing the modules using `pnpm add events axios`.

- **Private Property Access Errors**
  - Encountered errors related to accessing private properties in the test file.
  - Resolved by adding public getter methods to the `SentientAgentClient` class.

- **Merge Conflict Errors**
  - Encountered merge conflict errors in the `src/interface/session.ts` file.
  - These errors were unrelated to the migration process and were caused by a merge conflict in the file.
